Welcome to the Hackaday 2019 Supercon Badge Workshop repository.

For the workshop you will need to install the FPGA & RISC-V toolchain.

Follow the instructions in the official badge fpgasoc repository: https://github.com/spritetm/hadbadge2019_fpgasoc#how-to-use

You will find two subdirectories in here:
* basic -> the basic workshop
* advanced -> the advanced workshop

In each directory you will find a PDF with a guide.

The workshops are self-directed, this means if you happen to have a spot in the
workshop the helpers are there to answer your questions and help you out, not
to bore you with presentations.

The self-directed part also means that you should be able to complete the
workshop at your own speed by yourself. If you did not get a spot in the
workshop but have the necessary hardware, you should be able to complete the
class. If you have questions regarding the workshops [1BitSquared has created a
supercon-fpga-badge channel for that on their Discord](https://1bitsquared.com/pages/chat). Join us!

Also if you find mistakes anywhere send in a pull request or open an issue on
the GitHub repository. :D
