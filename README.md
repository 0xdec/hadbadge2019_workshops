Welcome to the Hackaday 2019 Supercon Badge Workshop repository.

For the workshop you will need to install the FPGA & RISC-V toolchain.

Follow the instructions in the official badge fpgasoc repository: 
https://github.com/spritetm/hadbadge2019_fpgasoc#how-to-use

You will find two subdirectories in here:
* basic -> the basic workshop
* advanced -> the advanced workshop

In each directory you will find a PDF with a guide.

The workshops are selfdirected, this means if you happen to have a spot in the
workshop the helpers are there to answer your questions and help you out, not
to bore you with presentations.

The selfdirected part also means that you should be able to complete the
workshop at your own speed by yourself. If you did not get a spot in the
workshop but have the necessary hardware, you should be able to complete the
class. If you have questions regarding the workshops 1BitSquared has created a
channel for that on their Discord. Join us!

Also if you find mistakes anywhere send in a pull request or open an issue on
the GitHub repository. :D
